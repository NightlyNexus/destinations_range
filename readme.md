These are most of the source files for a few of my SteamVR Home environments, including the Scripted Item Test Range.

Usage:

1. Copy the directory of the addon to \SteamVR\tools\steamvr_environments\content\steamtours_addons\

2. Create a new directory with the same name under 
\SteamVR\tools\steamvr_environments\game\steamtours_addons\

3. Move the scripts directory and the addoninfo.txt file from the copied over directory to the created directory.


The add-ons themself are available here:
