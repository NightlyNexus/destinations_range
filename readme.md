These are most of the source files for a few of my SteamVR Home environments, including the Scripted Item Test Range.

Usage:
1. Copy the directory of the addon to `\SteamVR\tools\steamvr_environments\content\steamtours_addons\`
2. Create a new directory with the same name under 
`\SteamVR\tools\steamvr_environments\game\steamtours_addons\`
3. Move the scripts directory and the addoninfo.txt file from the copied over directory to the created directory.
4. To see the compiled assets not included here, subscribe to the environments listed below. Once they have finished downloading, navigate to `\Steam\SteamApps\workshop\content\250820\` and find the directory with the name matching the Workshop ID number from the end of repective link visible below. Open up the VPK archinve inside with a tool like [GCFScape](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/GCFScape), and extract the materials and models directories into the directory you created under `/game/`.
