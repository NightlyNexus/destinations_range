Gravity affects the player as long as the locomotion is active.\nOff: No forced movement. Nothing can move the player apart from the stock teleport."

		"Pause_Setting_Phys_MoveModeForceEntity" "Force Entity"
		"Pause_Setting_Phys_MoveMode_Desc" "Override the player movement mode.\n\nNormally the physics system switches between movement modes automatically depending on what best suits the situation.\nDirect mode moves the playspace anchor directly at half the framerate. This is required for the motion controller positions to be updated correctly, but can introduce movement lag on joined players.\nEntity mode parents the player to a separate entity, which is controlled by setting its velocity. This may improve lag, but introduces lag to motion controller positions."
